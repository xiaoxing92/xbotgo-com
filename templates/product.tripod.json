We are still working on Blink tripod T4 and it should be launched on US market early Oct. <\/p><p>In both cases, the customized tripods should provide a great user experience. That being said, you could also choose a third-party tripod. Look for 1\/4\" screw in head. The majority of tripods on the market should support that and thus compatible with Focos gimbal. <\/p>"}},"8a49daa0-88fd-42dd-863b-dd95d7b6316d":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How does cloud storage work?","answer":"<p>For now, we wouldn’t charge anything for the cloud storage.
